# vscode-readme

This was inspired by [@katherinepeterson](https://www.github.com/katherinepeterson) who made the wonderful [readme.so](https://readme.so/)! Huge thanks.



## Configuration

Make sure you have quickSuggestions enabled in your `settings.json`. By default VSCode turns this off for Markdown.


```
{
    "[markdown]": {
      "editor.quickSuggestions": true
    }
},
```

## Usage

If you want all the sections below you can use the snippet:
```
